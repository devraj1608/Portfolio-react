# Portfolio 
In this project I have used Html, css,javascript and React with Vite.
I have created a simple portfolio website with a home page, about page, projects page and contact page
The website is responsive and looks good on all devices.
I have used React hooks for state management and React Router for routing.

I have also used Vite for building and serving the website.
I have used a simple CSS framework for styling.
I have used a simple JavaScript library for animations.
